[00:02.67] Never would've made it
[00:07.42] Never could've made it without You
[00:15.94] Without You
[00:22.13] Uh
[00:23.13] 
[00:22.58] Whole lotta O's gettin' sold on the block
[00:24.82] Don't go outside a lot, ain't tryna get popped
[00:27.66] 12 bustin' in while we scrapin' out the pot
[00:30.48] We runnin' out the spot, we runnin' out the spot
[00:54.48] 
[00:33.13] Singin', "Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got"
[00:35.99] Somebody's gettin' knocked while the bodies gettin' dropped
[00:38.85] I used to have a little, now a nigga got a lot
[00:41.46] I pray the Lord watch, I pray the Lord watch
[01:03.46] 
[00:44.61] Another year goes by, another nigga slayed
[00:47.78] At the West Indian Day Parade when perpetrators sprayed
[00:50.67] You got the nerve to ask why I stay in the house more
[00:53.50] Get paid for goin' in, the fuck I'm goin' out for?
[01:18.50] 
[00:56.21] When niggas stretchin' shit like a new school power forward
[00:58.91] Naz Reid range, but when these boys are shootin', niggas start breathin' strange
[01:03.33] Heartbeat is faint, now it's auf wiedersehen
[01:06.39] I'm not German, but the wheels currently turnin' on my mama's automobiles
[01:10.77] Certain of y'all while y'all prefer to be hard
[01:13.32] Memories of my dawg's wake, it's hurtin' me, y'all
[01:16.44] The windows to his soul closed, saw its curtains be drawn
[01:44.94] 
[01:19.36] Innocent as a child, but weren't we all?
[01:21.71] Before the hos and the smoke that arose from the Black and Mild cigarellos
[01:25.01] Triggers lift the biggest fellows, put seven on his torso and turned him into Melo, uh
[01:30.44] But no midrange iso, back to the basket
[01:33.81] The streets raised him a bastard, wrapped in a casket
[01:36.55] Best beware, don't you dare go laugh at the tragic passin' of somebody's son by somebody's gun
[02:23.55] 
[01:41.33] Give a fuck if you opps, when dissin' the dead, the karma tends to come at you hot
[01:45.87] I promise you pray for forgiveness, the Lord's wrath can astonish you
[01:49.32] I'd rather admonish you on this record than impress with perceptions of a designer shoe
[01:54.03] Fuck Gucci, fuck Louis, fuck Chanel, fuck Balenciaga, how we gon' excel?
[01:58.32] Soon as niggas make it out, they turnin' Hollywood as hell
[02:01.33] I knew buddy caught that body, but hell, I prolly shouldn't tell, or else I
[02:38.83] 
[02:07.01] Never would've made it
[02:11.44] I mean, I, never could've made it without You (yeah)
[02:37.44] 
[02:17.08] Got a soft spot for the man up above
[02:18.40] Eastside, Westside, show me love (without You)
[02:21.48] Niggas duck shots and some niggas catch slugs
[02:24.18] Northside, Southside, show me love, huh
[02:43.68] 
[02:28.06] Whole lotta O's gettin' sold on the block
[02:30.65] Don't go outside a lot, ain't tryna get popped
[02:32.59] 12 bustin' in while we scrapin' out the pot
[02:35.25] We runnin' out the spot, we runnin' out the spot
[02:59.25] 
[02:38.72] Singin', "Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got"
[02:41.40] Somebody's gettin' knocked while the bodies gettin' dropped
[02:43.85] I used to have a little, now a nigga got a lot
[02:46.72] I pray the Lord watch, I pray the Lord watch, uh
[03:10.72] 
[02:50.23] Someone that's close to me is facin' time
[02:52.25] My mind's racin' for some way to find, hope that he may be fine
[02:55.79] He got a son the same age as mine
[02:57.94] I can't imagine spendin' days in a cage not raisin' mine
[03:25.94] 
[03:01.18] These are the years with our kids where we strengthen bonds
[03:04.35] I paid his bond, but the trial's comin'
[03:06.64] The rain or shine, I know his child love him
[03:08.79] But he's too young to understand it if the outcome is incarceration and charges facin'
[03:51.79] 
[03:14.10] Bring the possibility of long vacations and complications with his baby mom
[03:18.55] She daily cryin', sayin' her heart is vacant
[03:20.85] He tryna make it work, he wanna fake it for the sake of family
[03:24.32] But she keep throwin' old shit right in his face apparently
[03:27.33] Remindin' him 'bout how he tried to make her take a plan B and abort the seed
[03:31.37] Threatenin' him with child support so that the court can seize and garnish wages
[04:11.37] 
[03:35.26] And all this was before he caught this case that's brought the latest
[03:38.15] Pile of stress to add to all this mess, it's hard to face it
[03:40.71] His thoughts deflated, somewhere 'long the way, he lost his faith
[03:43.77] But now he reads the Bible hopin' God'll see him contemplative
[04:14.77] 
[03:46.70] Never would've made it
[03:51.70] He prayin' now, he even threw some gospel on his playlist
[03:53.37] Never could've made it without You
[03:56.69] Tears fallin', Marvin Sapp, "Never Would Have Made It"
[04:23.69] 
[04:00.38] Man up above
[04:02.03] Eastside, Westside, show me love (without You)
[04:04.53] Niggas duck shots and some niggas catch slugs
[04:06.08] Northside, Southside, show me love, uh, huh
[04:27.58] 
[04:09.67] Whole lotta O's gettin' sold on the block
[04:12.95] Don't go outside a lot, ain't tryna get popped
[04:14.86] 12 bustin' in while we scrapin' out the pot
[04:17.42] We runnin' out the spot, we runnin' out the spot
[04:41.42] 
[04:20.77] Singin', "Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got"
[04:24.59] Somebody's gettin' knocked while the bodies gettin' dropped
[04:26.27] I used to have a little, now a nigga got a lot
[04:28.96] I pray the Lord watch, I pray the Lord watch
[04:50.96] 
[04:32.74] For me (never would've made it)
[04:39.24] Oh, I never could've made it (never could've made it without You)
[04:48.61] Without You
