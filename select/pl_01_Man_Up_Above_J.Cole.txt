Never would have made it
Never could have made it
Without You
Without You
Uh
Whole lotta O's gettin'
sold on the block
Don't go outside a lot,
ain't tryna get popped
12 bustin' in while
we scrapin' out the pot
We runnin' out the spot,
we runnin' out the spot
Singin', "Don't be fooled
by the rocks that I got"
Somebody's gettin' knocked
while the bodies gettin' dropped
I used to have a little,
now, a nigga got a lot
I pray the Lord watch,
I pray the Lord watch
Another year goes by,
another nigga slayed
At the West Indian Day Parade
when perpetrators sprayed
You got the nerve to ask
why I stay in the house more
Get paid for goin' in
the fuck I'm goin' out for?
When niggas stretchin' shit
like a new school power forward
Naz Reid range
But when these boys is shootin',
niggas start breathin' strange
Heartbeat is faint,
now, it's auf wiedersehen
I'm not German,
but the wheels currently turnin'
On my mama's automobile certainly are,
while y'all prefer to be hard
Memories of my dawg's wake,
it's hurtin' me, y'all
The windows to his soul closed,
saw his curtains be drawn
Innocent as a child,
but weren't we all?
Before the hoes
and the smoke that arose
From the Black and Mild cigarillos,
triggers lift the biggest fellows
Put seven on his torso
and turned him into Melo, uh
But no midrange iso,
back to the basket
The streets raised him a bastard,
wrapped in a casket
Best beware,
don't you dare go laugh at the tragic
Passing of somebody's son
by somebody's gun
Give a fuck if you opps,
when dissin' the dead,
the karma tends to come at you hot
I promise you
Pray for forgiveness,
the Lord's wrath can astonish you
I'd rather admonish you
on this record than impress
with perceptions of a designer shoe
Fuck Gucci, fuck Louis, fuck Chanel
Fuck Balenciaga, how we gon' excel?
Soon as niggas make it out,
they turnin' Hollywood as hell
I knew buddy caught that body,
but hell, I probably shouldn't tell
Or else, I
Never would have made it
I mean, I
Never could have made it (Yeah)
Without You
Got a soft spot for the man up above
Eastside, Westside, show me love
(Without You)
Niggas duck shots
and some niggas catch slugs
Northside, Southside, show me love
Whole lotta O's gettin'
sold on the block
Don't go outside a lot,
ain't tryna get popped
12 bustin' in while
we scrapin' out the pot
We runnin' out the spot,
we runnin' out the spot
Singin', "Don't be fooled
by the rocks that I got"
Somebody's gettin' knocked
while the bodies gettin' dropped
I used to have a little,
now, a nigga got a lot
I pray the Lord watch,
I pray the Lord watch, uh
Someone that's close to me
is facin' time
My mind's racin' for some way
to find hope that he may be fine
He got a son the same age as mine
I can't imagine spendin' days
in a cage not raisin' mine
These are the years with our kids
where we strengthen bonds
I paid his bond,
but the trial's comin'
Yo, rain or shine,
I know his child love him
But he's too young to understand it
if the outcome is incarceration
The charges facin'
bring the possibility
of long vacations and complications
With his baby mom
She daily cryin',
sayin' her heart is vacant
He tryna make it work,
he wanna fake it
for the sake of family
But she keep throwin' old shit right
in his face, apparently
Remindin' him 'bout how he tried
to make her take a plan B
And abort the seed
Threatenin' him with child support
so that the court can seize
and garnish wages
And all this was
before he caught this case
that's brought the latest
Pile of stress to add
to all this mess,
it's hard to face it
His thoughts deflated,
somewhere 'long the way,
he lost his faith
But now he reads the Bible hopin'
God'll see him contemplative
Never would have made it
He prayin' now,
even threw some gospel
on his playlist
Never could have made it
Tears fallin', Marvin Sapp,
"Never Would Have Made It"
(Without You)
Man up above
Eastside, Westside, show me love

Singin', "Don't be fooled

Somebody's gettin' knocked
while the bodies gettin' dropped
I used to have a little,
now, a nigga got a lot
I pray the Lord watch,
I pray the Lord watch for me
Never would have made it
(Oh, I never could have made it)
Never could have made it
